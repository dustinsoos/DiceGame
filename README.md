This project was definitely a fun first solo project in my bootcamp

Creating a game for everytime you refresh player 1 or player 2 wins or it can be a draw!

In this game I used HTML/CSS/JS

This was a project to get more used to JS with the use of variables as well as innerHTML

With the use of DOM manipulation was able to change everything on the page the way the challenge asked
